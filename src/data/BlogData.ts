        </div>

        <p><strong>Lohagad Fort</strong>, meaning "Iron Fort," is one of Maharashtra's most popular trekking destinations and a crown jewel among <strong>tourist attractions near Pawana Lake</strong>.

        <h2 id="tikona-fort">‚õ∞Ô∏è Tikona Fort - The Triangular Marvel</h2>

        <p><strong>Tikona Fort</strong>, also known as Vitandgad, gets its name from its distinctive triangular shape when viewed from the base. This lesser-known gem is perfect for those seeking a more challenging trek and pristine natural beauty.</p>

        <div class="callout callout-info">
          <h4>üìç Essential Information</h4>
